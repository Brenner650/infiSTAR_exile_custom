[infiSTAR.de](http://www.infiSTAR.de) Exile custom changes
=============
mainly for testing purpose (testing with my friends at http://www.mgtrolls.eu/)

Updates
--------------------------
- Added servermod to get rid of most of un-needed supply objects (will speed your server up very nicely) -servermod=@Exile_FPS;

Bit info:
--------------------------
- MPMission has another readme.txt :)
- You should disable:
"CfgSettings" >> "LootSettings" >> "notifyPlayer" by putting it to 0 (is 1 by default)
that will save the server a good amount of work!
